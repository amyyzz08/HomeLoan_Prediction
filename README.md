# **Home Loan Prediction using Machine Learning**

<h3><b>Purpose and Motivation</b></h3>
<hr>
<p>A lot of factors are considered when making the decision wheather or not a home loan is approved by Banks or other financial institutions. 
</p>

<p>With the help of machine learning and the details of an applicants details of their current living and financial situations, we can predict if the applicant is eligible for a particular home loan or not.</p>

<p>Following this notion, I was curious to see what factors would impact the loan approval status the most and the strength of these correlations.</p>

<h3><b>About the Data</b></h3>
<hr>
<p>The dataset used in this project is found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle.com</a></p>
<p>Below shows the variables and its definitions</p>

Variable|Definition|
|:----------|:----------|
|Gender|Male or Female|
|Married|Applicant Married (Y/N)|
|Dependants|Number of dependents the applicant has|
|Edcuation|Applicant's education (Graduate/Undergraduate)|
|Self_Employed|Is the applicant self-employed? (Y/N)|
|ApplicantIncome|Applicant's income| 
|CoapplicantIncome|Co-Applicant's income| 
|LoanAmount|The loan amount the apllicant wishes to apply for (in thousands)| 
|Credit_History|Does the credit history meet the guidelines (Y/N)|
|Property_Area|What area type is the protery located at? (Urban/Semi-Urban/Rural)|

<h3><b>Selecting the Model</b></h3>
<hr>
<p>For this project, the type of Machine Learning algorithm that was focussed on was Supervised Learning. The ML algorithm was given a sample of data to train on where the dependent variable being the approval loan status was present.</p>
<p>The remiaing data set was used as the test sample and the dependent variable is removed to see how accurate the model is.</p>
<p>The chosen model for this project is a Logistic Regression model where the prediction will be classified as either the loan will be approved (Y) or no the loan will not be approved (N)
